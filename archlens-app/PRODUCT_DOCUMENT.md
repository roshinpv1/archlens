# CloudArc - Product Overview

## What is CloudArc?

CloudArc is an intelligent platform that helps organizations understand, improve, and manage their cloud architectures. Think of it as a smart assistant that analyzes your cloud infrastructure, identifies potential issues, and suggests improvements—all while learning from your organization's best practices.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Organizations struggle with:
- **Understanding complex cloud architectures** - Diagrams and code are hard to analyze manually
- **Finding security and compliance gaps** - Easy to miss critical issues
- **Optimizing costs** - Unclear where money is being wasted
- **Learning from past projects** - Hard to find similar architectures for reference
- **Standardizing best practices** - No centralized knowledge base

CloudArc solves these challenges by automatically analyzing architectures, finding issues, and providing actionable recommendations.
